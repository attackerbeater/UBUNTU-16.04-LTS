## Magento 2 theme based on Bootstrap

This is a Magento 2 theme based on Bootstrap.


![Theme Preview](https://github.com/webgriffe/theme-bootstrap/raw/master/media/preview.png)

The theme has been designed to be overridden by project's specific theme.

For example you can override only the `bootstrap-theme.less` and `_variables.less` files to completely customize the look and feel of your theme.

Installation
------------

Add this repository to Composer's repositories and then require the theme:

```
composer config repo.bootstrap-menu vcs https://github.com/webgriffe/module-bootstrap-menu
composer config repo.bootstrap-theme vcs https://github.com/webgriffe/theme-bootstrap.git
composer require webgriffe/theme-frontend-bootstrap "dev-master"
```

Then you should run Magento's setup upgrade:

```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

Now you activate the Bootstrap Theme under `Content -> Design -> Configuration.`.

Lastly clear Magento generated suff and caches:

```
rm -rf pub/static/frontend/
rm -rf var/view_preprocessed/css/frontend/
php bin/magento cache:clean
```
