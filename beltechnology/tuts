                      function doTheSubmit() {
                        window.opener.location.reload(); //reload parent windows
                      }
                      </script> it's from child form


- best answer:
 - add this to your ajax succes message area window.opener.location.reload(); if you want to load parent windows from child windows form submitted by ajax :)
